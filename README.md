## Description

Tic Tac Toes is the classic Tic Tac Toe game with a twist. Instead of a single 3x3 board, there are 9 boards arranged in a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking spaces in these boards, aiming to win individual boards and ultimately achieve the highest total score.

The game follows the following rules:

- Each player plays on one board during their turn.
- The next player must play on the board that matches the position of the square the previous player filled.
- If the next board is finished, the player can choose any available board to play on.
- Once all boards are finished, the player with the most wins is the total winner, or it's a draw if both players have the same number of wins.
- The first move can be played on any board.
